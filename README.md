# Paragliding Task Competition Map

This repository contains an HTML page that displays a map for a paragliding task competition. The map highlights the task's waypoints and rules. The competition has specific rules and scoring mechanisms outlined below.

## Competition Rules

### General Rules
- **Free Takeoff:** Pilots can take off from any location.
- **Flexible Timing:** Takeoffs can happen at any time from dawn to dusk.
- **Mandatory Start:** Pilots must begin the task from the designated "Start" point.
- **Waypoint Scoring:** Each waypoint has a unique score based on its difficulty and can only be counted once. The pilot decides the order in which they will reach the waypoints.
- **Landing and Restarting:** If a pilot lands, they are allowed to restart, but they must reach a takeoff point by hiking.

### Scoring System
- **Total Score:** The total score is the sum of points from all visited waypoints.
- **Tie-Breaker:** In case of a tie in total points, the winner is determined by the least amount of time taken from the start point to the final waypoint.

### Categories
- **Open:** This category is open to all pilots.
- **Fun:** This category is for pilots with limited cross-country experience and who are flying gliders with a maximum rating of EN B.
